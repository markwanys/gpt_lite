# GPT-Lite
This project attempts to build GPT from scratch using findings from the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

This project will only include the decoder component of GPT. This component can be used to generate text given a starting token or phrase. For this project specifically, the goal is to generate a story in "Dr. Seuss" style using a single starting token (refer to gpt_lite.ipynb).
